# Tribute-page

This is a tribute webpage on Richard Feynman designed by Anvay Yamijala, who is not only a great physicist but also a big role model to the brightest minds in the country.
This website is dedicated to Richard P. Feynman (1918-1988), scientist, teacher, raconteur, and drummer. He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb, expanded the understanding of quantum electrodynamics, translated Mayan hieroglyphics, and cut to the heart of the Challenger disaster. But beyond all of that, Richard Feynman was a unique and multi-faceted individual.
