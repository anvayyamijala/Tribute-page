			</h1>

			

<p>
				☛ Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in Queens, New York City, to Lucille née Phillips, a homemaker, and Melville Arthur Feynman. His family was Jewish.<br><br>

				☛ Richard Feynman lived from 1918 to 1988. He made his mark as an original genius, starting with his work on the Manhattan Project in his early twenties, through winning a Nobel Prize for his work in developing an understanding of quantum mechanics, and finally as a much-loved professor of undergraduate physics at Caltech.<br><br>
				☛ The Feynman method of thought was developed by a man who refused conventional wisdom at all turns and who sought to build his mental computer from the ground up, starting with an understanding of mathematics at a very young age. <br><br>
				☛ This was how Feynman approached all knowledge: What can I know for sure, and how can I come to know it? It resulted in his famous quote, “You must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.” Feynman believed it and practiced it in all of his intellectual work.
				<br><br> ☛ Feynman was also famous for another reason: his practical jokes and his jovial, interesting public personality, revealed in stories and books like the famous collection of anecdotes Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman. Feynman was a ballbuster from an early age, telling stories of picking safes at the Manhattan Project and playing the bongos in Brazil, breaking the image of the buttoned-up physics professor.

				<h1 class="title-RF">Richard Feynman Quotes</h1>

<p>
				<br><br> ☛ <i>“You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird… I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”</i>
				<br><br> ☛ <i>“I think it’s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don’t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we’re here. I don’t have to know an answer.”</i>
				<br><br> ☛ <i>“It doesn’t seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil — which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.” </i>
				<br><br> ☛<i> “The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to… No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.”</i>
				<br><br> ☛ <i>“The only way to have real success in science, the field I’m familiar with, is to describe the evidence very carefully without regard to the way you feel it should be. If you have a theory, you must try to explain what’s good and what’s bad about it equally. In science, you learn a kind of standard integrity and honesty.”</i>

<h1 class="title-RF">Suggested Readings on Richard Feynman</h1>

<p>
				<br><br> ☛ <strong>The Feynman Technique:</strong> The Best Way of Learning Anything — The famous Feynman Technique is a way of figuring out whether you really know something or you just know the name of it.
				<br><br> ☛ <strong>The Difference Between Knowing the Name of Something and Knowing Something </strong> — Feynman gives his most famous explanation of the difference between actually knowing something and merely knowing what it’s called.
				<br><br> ☛ <strong>Richard Feynman on Why Questions</strong> — Why ask why? What kind of why question are you actually trying to answer?
				<br><br> ☛ <strong>Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman</strong> — The definitive biography of Richard Feynman by the great scientific writer James Gleick. [BOOK]
				<br><br> ☛ <strong>“Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!”: Adventures of a Curious Character</strong> — This one has been a bestseller for a long time for a good reason. Feynman comes across as interesting, fun, and brilliant in a series of vignettes he wrote about his life.
				<br><br> ☛ <strong>Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics Explained by Its Most Brilliant Teacher </strong> — Pulled from the Lectures, these are some of the easier and non-mathematical lectures Feynman gave on the nature of reality.
				<br><br> ☛ <strong>Six Not-So-Easy Pieces: Einstein’s Relativity, Symmetry, and Space-Time</strong>— The second book pulled from the Lectures, this time with slightly more challenging material, but still readable by most.
